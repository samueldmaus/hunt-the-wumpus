HUNT THE WUMPUS

- Description
Hunt The Wumpus was originally created in 1972 by Gregory Yob. This version of the game is written entirely in C++ as the main assignment for CPROGRM 520 A - C++ Programming: Intermediate, the second class in the
Certificate in C++ Programming through the University of Washington Professional and Continuing Education.

- Rules
There are 3 hazards:
	A bottomless pit (you will feel a breeze nearby).
	A colony of bats that will pick you up and drop you in a random space--including potentially deadly spaces (you will hear flapping nearby).
	A fearsome, hungry, and unbathed wumpus (you will smell it nearby).
The wumpus is heavy; bats cannot lift him.
The wumpus is covered in suckers; he won't fall down the bottomless pit.
Firing an arrow that misses the wumpus may cause it to move.
You have 5 wumpus-piercing arrows.
Run out of arrows and you lose.
Enter a cave that contains a pit or the wumpus and you lose.
Shot the wumpus with an arrow and you win!

- Testing
Unit tests for this game are constructed using the CppUnitLite Library (lightweight version of CppUnit).
